    "## Assignment overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will experiment with binary classification on a text dataset. You will be classifying President Trump's official tweets to identify the device from which they were posted, as a proxy for predicting who the tweet was written by. (If you took INFO-2301 last year, you have seen this dataset, but we are using different algorithms this time.)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is known that Donald Trump uses an Android phone, and it has been observed that some of his tweets come from Android while others come from other devices (most commonly iPhone). It is widely believed that Android tweets are written by Trump himself, while iPhone tweets are written by other staff. For more information, you can read this [blog post by David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/), written prior to the election, which finds a number of differences in the style and timing of tweets published under these two devices. (Some tweets are written from other devices, but for simplicity the dataset for this assignment is restricted to these two.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classification task known as \"authorship attribution\", which is the task of inferring the author of a document when the authorship is unknown. We will see how accurately this can be done with linear classifiers using word features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to hand in\n",
    "\n",
    "You will submit the assignment on Piazza. A private note to the instructor should be submitted with the subject _\"Submission 2 from [your full name]\"_ with the submission file(s) as an attachment. The note should be submitted to the `submissions` folder (**not** the `hw2` folder).\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit a single Jupyter notebook named `hw2lastname.ipynb`, where lastname is replaced with your last name.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any output that is not part of your notebook, you may submit that as a separate document, in a single PDF named `hw2lastname.pdf`. For example, this assignment requires you to create plots. You could do it directly with python using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), but if you wanted to create them using other software, that's acceptable as long as you put all of the figures in a single document and you clearly label them with the corresponding deliverable number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission policies\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collaboration:** You are allowed to work with up to 3 people besides yourself. You are still expected to write up your own solution. Each individual must post their own submission on Piazza, and you must list the names of your group members in your Piazza note when you submit.\n",
    "- **Late submissions:** We allow each student to use up to 5 late days over the semester. You have late days, not late hours. This means that if your submission is late by any amount of time past the deadline, then this will use up a late day. If it is late by any amount beyond 24 hours past the deadline, then this will use a second late, and so on. Once you have used up all late days, late assignments will be given at most 50% credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asking for help\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to ask questions on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/colorado/fall2017/info4604). Do not post anything that you are turning in, but you can describe general things you observe about the algorithms. You may ask questions to help with debugging, but do not post your code. You can share error messages and describe what you are trying to do with your code, but try not to write enough to \"give away\" the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions specifically about this assignment should be posted in the `hw2` folder. If you have clarifications about what is being asked, you can tag the instructor in your post. If you have more general programming questions (for example, if you are having trouble installing packages, running the notebook, or working with `numpy`), post in the `python` folder. (You can post in multiple folders if both are relevant.)\n"

    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will experiment with perceptron and logistic regression in `sklearn`. Much of the code has already been written for you. We will use a class called `SGDClassifier` (which you should read about in the [sklearn documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier.html)), which  implements stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for a variety of loss functions, including both perceptron and logistic regression, so this will be a way to easily move between the two algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below will load the dataset, which has already been processed for you. There are two collections: the \"training\" data, which contains the tweets that you will use for training the classifiers, and the \"testing\" data, which are tweets that you will use to measure the classifier accuracy. The test tweets are instances the classifier has never seen before, so they are a good way to see how the classifier will behave on data it hasn't seen before. However, we still know the labels of the test tweets, so we can measure the accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, we will use what are called \"bag of words\" features, which are commonly used when doing classification with text. Each feature is a word, and the value of a feature for a particular tweet is $1$ if the tweet contains that word and $0$ if not. (There are other ways to assign values to bag of words features, but this binary approach is a simple one that we will use for now.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the block of code below to load the data. You don't need to do anything yet (unless you get an error trying to run the code). Move on to \"Problem 1\" next."

    "\n",
    "First, if you are unfamiliar with `pickle` in python, this is a way of writing the contents of a python variable to a file. The variables `D` and `D_test` were stored in files and have been loaded again. These variables contain an array of instances, where each instance is a list of two things: first, a string label, and second, a dictionary of features that are present in the instance.\n",

    "For example, if an instance's features are represented by the dictionary `{'see' : 1, 'you' : 1, 'tonight' : 1}`, this means that those three words were present in the tweet, while the values of all other word features are assumed to be $0$. [`DictVectorizer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.DictVectorizer.html) converts this dictionary representation into a feature vector representation that `sklearn` can use.\n",

    "The code below trains an [`SGDClassifier`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier.html) using the perceptron loss, then it measures the accuracy of the classifier on the test data, using `sklearn`'s [`accuracy_score`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html) function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `fit` function trains the classifier. The feature weights are stored in the `coef_` variable after training. The `predict` function of the trained `SGDClassifier` outputs the predicted label for a given instance or list of instances.\n",

    "Additionally, this code displays the features and their weights in sorted order, which you may want to examine to understand what the classifier is learning. In this dataset, the $\\textrm{Android}$ class is considered the \"negative\" class because it comes first, so if a feature has a negative weight, this means it is predictive of $\\textrm{Android}$, while a feature with a positive weight is predictive of the $\\textrm{iPhone}$ class.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 keyword arguments that have been added to the code below. It is important you keep the same values of these arguments whenever you create an `SGDClassifier` instance in this assignment so that you get consistent results. They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `max_iters` is one of the stopping criteria, which is the maximum number of iterations/epochs the algorithm will run for.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `tol` is the other stopping criterion, which is how small the difference between the current loss and previous loss should be before stopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `random_state` is a seed for pseudorandom number generation. The algorithm uses randomness in the way the training data are sorted, which will affect the solution that is learned, and even the accuracy of that solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait a minute $-$ in class we learned that the loss function is convex, so the algorithm will find the same minimum regardless of how it is trained. Why is there random variation in the output? The reason is that even though there is only one minimum value of the loss, there may be different weights that result in the same loss, so randomness is a matter of tie-breaking. What's more, while different weights may have the same loss, they could lead to different classification accuracies, because the loss function is not the same as accuracy. (Unless accuracy was your loss function... which is possible, but uncommon because it turns out to be a difficult function to optimize.)\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Deliverable 2.1: Based on the training accuracy, do you conclude that the data are linearly separable? Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that our data is linearly seperable. We have a 99% training accuracy, and all words have weights of either being negative, 0 or positive, so I assume that the words with weight 0 are no more likely to be in one group than the other, so I believe that our data is linearly seperable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deliverable 2.2: Which feature most increases the likelihood that the class is 'iPhone'? Based on the description of the dataset, why do you think this is the case?\n",
    "\n",
    "The URL feature most increases the likelihood that the class is 'iPhone.' I think this is the case, because many of the training data instances that were iPhones had a link in them, so the weight for that feature is much more positive than any other feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "One technique for improving the resulting model with perceptron (or stochastic gradient descent learning in general) is to take an average of the weight vectors learned at different iterations of the algorithm, rather than only using the final weights that minimize the loss. That is, calculate $\\bar{\\mathbf{w}} = \\sum_{t=1}^T \\mathbf{w}^{(t)}$ where $\\mathbf{w}^{(t)}$ is the weight vector at iteration $t$ of the algorithm and $T$ is the number of iterations, and then use $\\bar{\\mathbf{w}}$ when making classifications on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this technique in your classifier, add the keyword argument `average=True` to the `SGDClassifier` function. Try it now.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deliverable 2.3: Compare the initial training/test accuracies to the training/test accuracies after doing averaging. What happens? Why do you think averaging the weights from different iterations has this effect?\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial training accuracy is .996143 and the initial test accuracy is 0.859459. After averaging, the training accuracy is .991130 and the test accuracy is 0.875676. After averaging, the training accuracy decreased and the test accuracy increased. I think that averaging the weights from different iterations reduces the accuracies, because it averages all the different weights that give you the same loss minimum, and that happens to give you a lower training accuracy and a higher test accuracy.\n"

    "## Problem 3: Logistic regression [15 points]\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, create a new `SGDClassifier`, this time setting the `loss` argument to `'log'`, which will train a logistic regression classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have trained the classifier, you can use the `predict` function to get the classifications, as with perceptron. Additionally, logistic regression provides probabilities for the predictions. You can get the probabilities by calling the `predict_proba` function. This will give a list of two numbers; the first is the probability that the class is $\\textrm{Android}$ and the second is the probability that the class is $\\textrm{iPhone}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first task, add the keyword argument `alpha` to the `SGDClassifier` function. This is the regularization strength, called $\\lambda$ in lecture. If you don't specify `alpha`, it defaults to $0.0001$. Experiment with other values and see how this affects the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deliverable 3.1: Calculate the training and testing accuracy when `alpha` is one of $[0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0]$. Create a plot where the x-axis is `alpha` and the y-axis is accuracy, with two lines (one for training and one for testing). Use [a log scale for the x-axis](https://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/log_demo.html) so that the `alpha` values are spaced evenly.\n",
    "\n",
    "See below for graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deliverable 3.2: Examine the classifier probabilities using the `predict_proba` function when training with different values of `alpha`. What do you observe? How does `alpha` affect the prediction probabilities, and why do you think this happens?\n",
    "\n",
    "As alpha increases, the probabilities given become much closer together. For example, when alpha is 0.0001, the first feature has a 0.99985 probability of being sent from an Android and a 0.000149 probability of being sent from an iPhone. As alpha increases, the distance between those two probabilities decreases. For example, when alpha is set to 100, the first feature has a 0.6835819 probability of being an Android and a 0.3164181 probability of being an iPhone. As alpha increases, it seems that the classifier is less sure of its classificiation of each feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Now remove the `alpha` argument so that it goes back to the default value. We'll now look at the effect of the learning rate. By default, `sklearn` uses an \"optimal\" learning rate based on some heuristics that work well for many problems. However, it can be good to see how the learning rate can affect the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, add the keyword argument `learning_rate` to the `SGDClassifier` function and set the value to `invscaling`. This defines the learning rate at iteration $t$ as: $\\eta_t = \\frac{\\eta_0}{t^a}$, where $\\eta_0$ and $a$ are both arguments you have to define in the `SGDClassifier` function, called `eta_0` and `power_t`, respectively. Experiment with different values of `eta_0` and `power_t` and see how they affect the number of iterations it takes the algorithm to converge. You will often find that it will not finish within the maximum of $1000$ iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deliverable 3.3: Fill in the table below with the number of iterations for values of `eta_0` in $[10.0, 100.0, 1000.0, 10000.0]$ and values of `power_t` in $[0.5, 1.0, 2.0]$. You may find it easier to write python code that can output the markdown for the table, but if you do that place the output here. If it does not converge within the maximum number of iterations (set to $1000$ by `max_iters`), record $1000$ as the number of iterations.\n",

    "#### Deliverable 3.4: Describe how `eta_0` and `power_t` affect the learning rate based on the formula (e.g., if you increase `power_t`, what will this do to the learning rate?), and connect this to what you observe in the table above.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you increase 'power_t', the learning rate will decrease, because you will increase the denominator of the formula above. If you increase 'eta_0', the learning rate will increase, because you are increasing the numerator of the formula above. We see this in our data from the table above, in that when power_t is less than 1, it always converged with the numbers we used, and when power_t is greater than 1, it more often than not, diverges. This didn't occur only when our 'eta0' was set to a very large number, which counteracted the effect of the larger 'power_t' variable (as seen when eta0=10000 and power_t=1.0).\n",
    "   \n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Now remove the `learning_rate`, `eta_0`, and `power_t` arguments so that the learning rate returns to the default setting. For this final task, we will experiment with changing the threshold at which the probability of a class must be before making a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below includes a function called `threshold` which takes as input the classification probabilities of the data (called `probs`, which is given by the function `predict_proba`) and a threshold (called `tau`, a scalar that should be a value between $0$ and $1$). It will classify each instance as $\\textrm{Android}$ if the probability of being $\\textrm{Android}$ is greater than `tau`, otherwise it will classify the instance as $\\textrm{iPhone}$. Note that if you set `tau` to $0.5$, the `threshold` function should give you exactly the same output as the classifier `predict` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should find that increasing the threshold causes the accuracy to drop. This makes sense, because you are classifying some things as $\\textrm{iPhone}$ even though it's more probable that they are $\\textrm{Android}$. So why do this? Suppose you care more about accurately identifying the $\\textrm{Android}$ tweets and you don't care as much about `iPhone` tweets. You want to be confident that when you classify a tweet as $\\textrm{Android}$ that it really is $\\textrm{Android}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a metric called _precision_ which measures something like accuracy but for one specific class. Whereas accuracy is the percentage of tweets that were correctly classified, the precision of $\\textrm{Android}$ would be the percentage of tweets classified as $\\textrm{Android}$ that were correctly classified. (In other words, the number of tweets classified as $\\textrm{Android}$ whose correct label was $\\textrm{Android}$, divided by the number of tweets classified as $\\textrm{Android}$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the [`precision_score`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.precision_score.html#sklearn.metrics.precision_score) function from `sklearn` to calculate the precision. It works just like the `accuracy_score` function, except you have to add an additional keyword argument, `pos_label='Android'`, which tells it that $\\textrm{Android}$ is the class you want to calculate the precision of.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deliverable 3.5: Calculate the testing precision when the value of `tau` for thresholding is one of $[0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99]$. Create a plot where the x-axis is `tau` and the y-axis is precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "See below for graph\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deliverable 3.6: Describe what you observe with thresholding (e.g., what happens to precision as the threshold increases?), and explain why you think this happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the threshold increases, the precision decreases. This is because you are classifying some things as iPhone when it is more probable that they are Android."

You should see this effect if you examine the values of `classifier.coef_`.\n",

Create a plot where the x-axis is `alpha` and the y-axis is the number of nonzero weights, using a log scale for the x-axis.\n",
